Hi, I am Jifeng Song, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). I received my B.E. from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). I currently focus on efficient machine learning. During my undergraduate time, I focused on transfer learning applications in renewable energy.

Here is my [CV](http://Muhusystem.github.io/files/CV_JifengSong.pdf). My current work is enabling <b>efficient inference</b> by achieving sparse activation in LLMs and <b>Small Language Models (SLMs)</b> like Phi-2, Mobillama-0.5B, and Gemma-2B models. To search for the optimal subset of model structures, we employ several <b>eXplainable AI (XAI)</b> methods, including Gradient multiple Output Magnitude (GxO), Integrated Gradients (IG), SNIP, and Fisher information. Also, we propose Corrected GxO scores to measure neuron importance. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework supporting the efficiency of these corrected attribution scores.
