Hi, I am Jifeng Song, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). I received my B.E. from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). I currently focus on efficient machine learning and system. During my undergraduate time, I focused on transfer learning application in renewable energy.

Here is my [CV](http://Muhusystem.github.io/files/CV_JifengSong.pdf). My current work is enabling efficient inference by achieving sparse activation in LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) like Phi-2, Mobillama-0.5B, and Gemma-2B models. To search for an efficient model structure, I also apply some eXplainable AI (XAI) methods like Integrated Gradient (IG), SNIP, Fisher information, and proposed the Corrected GxO scores for neuron importance measurement. We also provide a theoretical explanation for the efficiency of the proposed corrected attribution scores.
