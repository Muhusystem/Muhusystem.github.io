Hi, I am Jifeng Song, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and also a research assistant in the Cancer Virology Program at [UPMC Hillman Cancer Center](https://hillman.upmc.com/), co-advised by [Prof. Yufei Huang](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/yufei-huang) and [Prof. Zhi-Hong Mao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~zhm4/). My current research focuses on <b>multimodal large language models</b> and <b>AI for biomedical science</b>, with broader interests in AI for Science, explainable AI, and efficient large language models. I received my B.E. in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), where I worked on transfer learning for renewable energy forecasting.

Here is my [CV](http://Muhusystem.github.io/files/CV_JifengSong.pdf). My current work focuses on <b>domain-specific vision-language models for biomedical research</b>. I am training biomedical multimodal large models for cancer research, particularly in spatial transcriptomics and single-cell applications, covering tasks such as multimodal retrieval, question answering, and other text and image generation tasks.
