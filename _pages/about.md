Hi, I am Jifeng Song, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Yufei Huang](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/yufei-huang) and [Prof. Zhi-Hong Mao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~zhm4/). My current research focuses on multimodal large language models and AI for biomedical science, with broader interests in AI for Science, explainable AI, and efficient large language models. I received my B.E. in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), where I worked on transfer learning for renewable energy forecasting.

Here is my [CV](http://Muhusystem.github.io/files/CV_JifengSong.pdf). My current work focuses on <b>multimodal large language models</b> and <b>AI for scientific discovery</b>, especially <b>domain-specific vision–language models for biomedical research</b>. I am training <b>multimodal biomedical large models</b> for cancer research, particularly in <b>spatial transcriptomics</b> and <b>single-cell</b> applications, covering tasks such as multimodal retrieval, question answering, and other <b>text</b> and <b>image generation</b> tasks.
